
1.How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?


Use the mkdir command to create a new folder. To make that folder hidden, 
add a dot (.) at the beginning of the name, just like you would when renaming an existing folder to hide it. 
The touch command creates a new blank file in the current folder.

Use the terminal to display the . git directory with the command ls ls-a . 
The ls command lists the current directory contents and by default will not show hidden files. 
If you pass it the -a flag, it will display hidden files.

2.How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

use of -p flag with mkrdir in the examples; it is used to create intermediate directories as required — i.e. 
it will automatically produce the parent directories that do not exist.

ex
cd public
mkdir -p static/css static/js views/html
This will produce the following output:

public/
..└── static/
....└── css
....└── js
..└── views/
....└── html

3.How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:

echo new line
echo -e "hello\nworld"

echo -e "hello\nworld"
# Output
  /*
   * hello
   * world
   */
